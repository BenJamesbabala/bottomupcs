    <title>What is a process?</title>

    <para>We are all familar with the modern operating system running
    many tasks all at once or <emphasis>multitasking</emphasis>.  
    </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Process ID</title> 

      <para>The <emphasis>process ID</emphasis> (or the PID) is
      assigned by the operating system and is unique to each running
      process.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Memory</title> <para>We will learn exactly how a process
      gets it's memory in the following weeks -- it is one of the most
      fundamental parts of how the operating system works.  However,
      for now it is sufficient to know that each process gets it's own
      section of memory.</para>

      <para>Parts of the memory can be shared between process (called,
      not surprisingly <emphasis>shared memory</emphasis>).  You will
      often see this called <emphasis>System Five Shared
      Memory</emphasis> (or SysV SHM) after the original
      implementation in an older operating system.</para>

      <para>Another important concept a process may utilise is that of
      <emphasis>mmap</emphasis>ing a file on disk to memory.  This
      means that instead of having to open the file and use commands
      such as <computeroutput>read()</computeroutput> and
      <computeroutput>write()</computeroutput> the file looks as if it
      were any other type of RAM.</para>
