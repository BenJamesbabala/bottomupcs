    <title>Executable files</title>

    <para>We know that a program running in memory has two major
    components in <emphasis>code</emphasis> and
    <emphasis>data</emphasis>.  However, an executable does not live
    its life in memory, but spends most of its life as a file on a
    disk.</para>

    <para>This file needs to be in a specific format that the
    operating system can identify and load into memory.  This
    <emphasis>executable file format</emphasis> is specific to the
    operating system.</para>
